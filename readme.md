# GrandPad Data Dump

When my grandmother died, GrandPad/Consumer Cellular told me there was no way to provide me all the pictures, videos, and audio comments that she and my family had shared on the platform. This was shocking and heartbreaking for my family, which wanted to preserve my grandmother's comments on her grandchildren and great grandchildren's photos.

I figured out on my own how to access these photos and wrote a little script to preserve the data. I'm sharing it to help anyone in a similar situation.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Add your credentials to `sample_config.yml` and rename it to `config.yml`

## Usage

Run `python grandpad.py`
